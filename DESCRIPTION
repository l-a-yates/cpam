Description: cpam provides a comprehensive framework for time series omics analysis, 
  integrating changepoint detection, smooth and shape-constrained trends, 
  and uncertainty quantification. It supports gene- and transcript-level inferences, 
  p-value aggregation for improved power, and both case-only and case-control designs. 
  It includes an interactive Shiny interface.
