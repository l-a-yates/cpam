Description: Provides a comprehensive framework for time series omics analysis, 
  integrating changepoint detection, smooth and shape-constrained trends, 
  and uncertainty quantification. It supports gene- and transcript-level inferences, 
  p-value aggregation for improved power, and both case-only and case-control designs. 
  It includes an interactive Shiny interface. The methods are described in Yates et al
  <doi:10.1101/2024.12.22.630003>.
