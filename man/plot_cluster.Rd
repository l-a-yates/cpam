\title{Plot clustered targets}
\usage{
plot_cluster(cpo, res, changepoints, shapes, alpha = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{cpo}{a cpam object}

\item{res}{a tibble, output from \code{\link[=results]{results()}} containing columns target_id, cp, and shape}

\item{changepoints}{numerical or character; one or more changepoints (these should be the same as the ones used in \code{\link[=estimate_changepoint]{estimate_changepoint()}}}

\item{shapes}{character; one or more shapes (these should be the same as the ones used in \code{\link[=select_shape]{select_shape()}}}

\item{alpha}{numeric between 0 and 1; controls line transparency in plot (default: 0.1)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing overlaid fitted trends, or NULL if no matching
targets are found
}
\description{
Plot clustered targets
}
\details{
Plots the fitted trends for a set of targets whose estimated changepoints and
shapes are given by the arguments \code{changepoints} and \code{shapes}, respectively.

Creates a combined plot showing fitted expression trends for all targets that
share specified changepoint times and shape patterns. Each line represents one
target's fitted trajectory, with transparency controlled by alpha.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# Generate results table
res <- results(cpo)

# plot all targets with changepoint at timepoint 20 and shape "micv" (monotonic increasing concave)
plot_cluster(cpo, res, changepoints = "20", shapes = "micv")
}
