# cpam: Changepoint Additive Models for Time Series Omics Data

Provides a comprehensive framework for time series omics analysis,
integrating changepoint detection, smooth and shape-constrained trends,
and uncertainty quantification. It supports gene- and transcript-level
inferences, p-value aggregation for improved power, and both case-only
and case-control designs. It includes an interactive 'shiny' interface.
The methods are described in Yates et al. (2024)
